# Rain-Prediction

### About the Dataset
This Machine Learning Project is based on the dataset titled 'Rain in Australia', which itself was originally sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Daily Weather Observations . The objective of the project is to predict whether there will be raining tomorrow or not .

### About the models 

The problem is clearly a classification problem , so several classification models has been trained in order to get the prediction .The models that are used in the projects are

### - Logistic Regression
### - Decision Tree classifier
### - Random Forest classifier
### - CatBoost

The CatBoost model is having highest accuracy prediction with a accuracy percentage of 85 %.
